### Hello there! 👋

I am Jiedel, an IT Student in the Philippines and is passionate in programming, software engineering, and game development.

I enjoy reading e-books and developing software apps and tools that can boost my productivity, enhance time and self-management, or improve my skill set.

Currently aiming to enhance my web development skills while looking forward in game design and software engineering.

I do have familiarity with programming languages such as Javascript, Dart, and Python and software tools such as Git, VS Code, Cloud Console, Firebase, Ibis, K6, Slack, and more
