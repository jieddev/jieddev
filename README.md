### Hello there! 👋

I am Jiedel, a 4th year BSIT college student at Eastern Visayas State University in the Philippines.

I enjoy reading e-books and developing software apps and tools that can boost my productivity, enhance time and self-management, or improve my skill set.

Currently aiming to enhance my web development skills while looking forward in game design and software engineering.

I am still currently improving my main tech stack skills but I do have familiarity with programming languages such as Javascript, Dart, and Python and software tools such as Git, VS Code, Ibis, K6, Slack, and more
