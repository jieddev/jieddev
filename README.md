### Hello there! 👋

I am Jiedel, an IT Student in the Philippines and is passionate in programming, software engineering, and game development.

I enjoy reading e-books and developing software apps and tools that can boost my productivity, enhance time and self-management, or improve my skill set.

Currently aiming to enhance my web development skills while looking forward in game design and software engineering.
